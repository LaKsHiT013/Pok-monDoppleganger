# PokemonDoppleganger
This a ML model which guesses your pokemon lookalike

# What is used:
-> Used CNN Models to extract embeddings of Pokemons and store them in a CSV file.
-> Used models to extract the facial embeddings of a person who is using the app.
-> Then with the help of Cosine Similarity Algorithm Predicted the most closest pokemon.

# Improvements:
-> Currently classifies only 7 species of Pokemon, can be increased.
-> Instead taking only face and doing prediction the modelis highlt effected by the clothes and colour in the background for prediction.
